Pong Breakout
=============

A two-player pong game with power-ups inspired by Breakout

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
I've only tested this in the latest Chrome, Firefox and IE10. Note that chrome 23 has a bug that causes the ball to flicker. Update to the latest Chrome (24+) to fix the issue. 

TODO
----
* Implement end of game when certain score is reached
* Implement game pause
* Implement more power ups: Long Paddle, Short Paddle, Freeze Paddle, Flashing Paddle, Flashing Ball, Mystery/Random
* Refactor and generalize game logic
* Unit tests
